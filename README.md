In today's digital world, having an offical website is essential for school and universities.
A website acts as a digital frint door to the institution, providing accessible inforamtion to students, parents, teachers, and evenpotential enrollees.
It represent the school's identity and play a big role in communication and connection with the academic community.
Many school still rely on tradtional method such as bulletin boards or printed announcements, which can be easily missed or delayed.
Others user social media platforms, but these are often scattered and not organized enough for official school operations
This creates problems like missed deadlines, lack  of information, and confucion among students and parents.

To solve this, our project aims to find a website specifically designed for a school or university.
The website still serve as a central platform that includes important sections such as announcements, academic programs , enrollment procedures, contact information and more.
It will be user-friendly, responsive on all devices, and easy to update even by non-technical staff.

This is important in today's context, especially as technology continues to shape eductaion.
After the pandemic, online communication has become more crucial than ever schools must adapt by using digital tools that improve accessibilty, transparency, and operational efficiency
